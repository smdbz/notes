# Other types of serializers in DRF

## Introduction

You now know about serializers in DRF, and you learned how to use model serializers to serialise model relationships.
This reading has some interesting tips and tricks regarding serialisation, like how to automatically display a nested
model field using the depth option of the serializer. You will also learn how to display related model fields as
hyperlinks by using the HyperlinkedRelatedField or by using a new type of serializer called the
HyperlinkedModelSerializer.

Note: The code for this reading builds on what you just learned in the video, Relationship serializers.

## Nested fields

If you were to visit the menu-items endpoint, you would note the category displays as a nested field with its id, title,
and slug.
Menu-items endpoint displaying the category with a nested field with id, title and slug.

This can be achieved in two ways.
### Method 1

The first way to do this is to create a category serializer in serializers.py and include it in the menu item serializer
as demonstrated in the code below.

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from decimal import Decimal
from .models import MenuItem, Category 
class CategorySerializer (serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Category
        fields = ['id','slug','title']
        
class MenuItemSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    stock = serializers.IntegerField(source='inventory')
    price_after_tax = serializers.SerializerMethodField(method_name = 'calculate_tax')
    category = CategorySerializer()
        class Meta:
            model = MenuItem
            fields = ['id','title','price','stock', 'price_after_tax','category'] 
        def calculate_tax(self, product:MenuItem):
            return product.price * Decimal(1.1)
```

### Method 2

There is another way of doing this. Instead of declaring the category field as CategorySerializer, you can specify that
depth=1 is in the Meta class in MenuItemSerializer. This way, all relationships in this serializer will display every
field related to that model. You can change the code of the MenuItemSerializer as below.

```python
class MenuItemSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    stock = serializers.IntegerField(source='inventory')
    price_after_tax = serializers.SerializerMethodField(method_name = 'calculate_tax')
    # category = CategorySerializer()
    class Meta:
        model = MenuItem
        fields = ['id','title','price','stock', 'price_after_tax','category']
        depth = 1 
        
    def calculate_tax(self, product:MenuItem):
        return product.price * Decimal(1.1)
```

Note the commented line, category = CategorySerializer(). And the new line, depth = 1, was added in the Meta class. Now,
if you were to visit the menu items endpoint at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items, you’d note that the output is
exactly the same as it was before.

Displaying nested fields this way provides more information. It also reduces the amount of code the client application
developers need to write. This is because they don't have to make separate API calls to retrieve the details for those
nested fields any more.

Next, let’s focus on different serialisation techniques that you can use to display related model fields as hyperlinks.
## Display a related model fields field as a hyperlink

In DRF you can display every related model field as a hyperlink in the API output. Like
this:  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/category/{categoryId}  for the category field. There are two different ways to do this.
The first method is to use the serializer field called HyperlinkedRelatedField and for the second method you use the
HyperlinkedModelSerializer.
### Method 1: HyperlinkedRelatedField

#### Step 1: Create and map a new view function

Every HyperlinkedRelatedField field in a serializer needs a queryset to find the related object and a view name that is
used to map the hyperlinked URL pattern.

Thus you have to create a new function in the views.py file that will handle the categoryId endpoints.
````python
from .models import Category from .serializers import CategorySerializer

@api_view()
def category_detail(request, pk):
    category = get_object_or_404(Category,pk=pk)
    serialized_category = CategorySerializer(category)
    return Response(serialized_category.data)
````

Then you map this function in the urls.py file with a view name.
````python
path('category/<int:pk>',views.category_detail, name='category-detail')
````

Tip: There is a convention you must follow when you create this view name. The rule is that you have to add -detail
after the related field name, which is category in the MenuItemSerializer. This is why the view name was category-detail
in this code. If the related field name was user, the view name would be user-detail.

#### Step 2: Create a HyperLinkedRelatedField in the serializer

The next step is to change the MenuItemSerializer code. The following code sets the category field as a
HyperLinkedRelatedField in the MenuItem serializer.
````python
from .models import Category

class MenuItemSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    stock =  serializers.IntegerField(source='inventory')
    price_after_tax = serializers.SerializerMethodField(method_name = 'calculate_tax')

    category = serializers.HyperlinkedRelatedField(
        queryset = Category.objects.all(),
        view_name='category-detail'

    )

    class Meta:
        model = MenuItem
        fields = ['id','title','price','stock', 'price_after_tax','category']    

    def calculate_tax(self, product:MenuItem):
        return product.price * Decimal(1.1)
````

Note how a queryset and a view name are provided in the category HyperlinkedRelatedField. The code follows the
convention so you can remove the line, view_name='category-detail. It is only necessary if you didn’t follow the
convention and you created the view name in a different way in the urls.py file.

#### Step 3: Add context

The final step is to add context to the MenuItemSerializer in the menu_items function, as below.
````python
serialized_item = MenuItemSerializer(items, many=True, context={'request': request})
````

Note: The argument <code>context={'request': request}</code> lets the menu-items endpoint display the category field as
a hyperlink.
Menu-items endpoint displays the category field as a hyperlink

You can click on that hyperlink and check the category details.
Category details that display after clicking on hyperlink
### Method 2: HyperlinkedModelSerializer

But there is another way to display a category field as a hyperlink. With this method, you need to change the code in
the serializers.py file. so that the MenuItemSerializer extends the serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer class instead
of the serializers.ModelSerializer class.
````python
class MenuItemSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    stock =  serializers.IntegerField(source='inventory')
    price_after_tax = serializers.SerializerMethodField(method_name = 'calculate_tax')

    class Meta:
        model = MenuItem
        fields = ['id','title','price','stock', 'price_after_tax','category']
    def calculate_tax(self, product:MenuItem):
        return product.price * Decimal(1.1)
````

When you use the HyperlinkedModelSerializer the output of the menu-items endpoint produces the same output with a
hyperlinked category field like in the screenshot in Method 1 but the code is much cleaner and simpler.

Note: When you use a HyperlinkedModelSerializer, you still need the URL pattern with a view name as you did in the
previous section.
````python
urlpatterns = [ 
    path('menu-items',views.menu_items),
    path('menu-items/<int:id>',views.single_item),
    path('category/<int:pk>',views.category_detail, name='category-detail')

]
````

also learned how to display a related field as a hyperlink using HyperlinkedRelatedField and HyperlinkedModelSerializer.
