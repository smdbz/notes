# Different types if routing in DRF

## Introduction

The Django REST framework provides different ways of URL mapping or routing in an API project. Besides the traditional
style of routing, there are other routing techniques that can save you time while developing. In this reading, you are
going to learn about both traditional and other techniques.

Note: All the routings should be done in the urls.py file in your Django app.

## Regular routes

The code below maps a function from a views.py file to an API endpoint. Don’t forget that you have to import the path
function from the django.urls module first.

 ```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
	path('books’,views.books) ,
]
 ```

This URL pattern maps the books function to the /api/books endpoint. You already know how to specify which HTTP methods
a function view can serve by supplying them in the api_decorator function. The following code allows any function view
to serve both HTTP GET and POST methods.

```python
@api_view([‘GET’,’POST’])
```

## Routing to a class method

If you map a specific method from a class, then you need to declare that method as a @staticmethod first. After that,
you can map it in the urls.py file. Here’s an example of a class in the views.py file.

```python
class Orders():
	@staticmethod
	@api_view()
	def listOrders(request):
	    return Response({'message':'list of orders'}, 200)
```

You can also map this listOrders method in the urls.py file as follows.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
	path('orders', views.Orders.listOrders)
]
```

## Routing class-based views

You can save a lot of time in DRF by mapping a class that extends the APIview. You don’t need to individually map every
method of such classes. In an upcoming video, Function and class-based views, you will learn that such classes have HTTP
verb-specific methods inside them. When a class extends APIview or generic views, you can simply map those classes in
the urls.py file.

Here’s the code of the class that extends the APIView.

```python
class BookView(APIView):
	def get(self, request, pk):
		return Response({"message":"single book with id " + str(pk)}
		, status.HTTP_200_OK)
    def put(self, request, pk):
        return Response({"title":request.data.get('title')}
        , status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

And here is how you map this class in the urls.py file. All you have to do is map the class as a view against an
endpoint.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('books/<int:pk>',views.BookView.as_view())
]
```

Now you can make HTTP, GET and PUT calls to the /api/books/{bookId} endpoint without issues. If the class has post(),
delete() and patch() methods, it will work with HTTP POST, DELETE and PATCH methods too.

## Routing classes that extend viewsets

You can have classes that extend the different types of ViewSets in your API project. Just like the classes that extend
APIView, these classes also have specific methods used to respond to different types of HTTP requests. Here’s an example
of a typical class that extends the viewset.Viewset class.

```python
Class BookView(viewsets.ViewSet):
	def list(self, request):
	    return Response({"message":"All books"}, status.HTTP_200_OK)
	def create(self, request):
	    return Response({"message":"Creating a book"}, status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
	def update(self, request, pk=None):
	    return Response({"message":"Updating a book"}, status.HTTP_200_OK)
	def retrieve(self, request, pk=None):
        return Response({"message":"Displaying a book"}, status.HTTP_200_OK)
	def partial_update(self, request, pk=None):
        return Response({"message":"Partially updating a book"}, status.HTTP_200_OK)
	def destroy(self, request, pk=None):
    	return Response({"message":"Deleting a book"}, status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

You can map this class in the urls.py file in your Django app as follows.

```python
urlpatterns = [
	path('books', views.BookView.as_view(
	{
	    'get': 'list',
	    'post': 'create',
    })
	),
	path('books/<int:pk>',views.BookView.as_view(
	{
	    'get': 'retrieve',
	    'put': 'update',
	    'patch': 'partial_update',
	    'delete': 'destroy',
    })
	)
]
```

Notice how the HTTP verbs are mapped with each method in this class. Also, note that both the list() and retrieve()
methods are present. The list() method is used to display all books, and the retrieve() method is used to display a
single book.

After this mapping, you can access the  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books  endpoint with GET and POST methods. While you
can access the http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/1  endpoint with GET, PUT, PATCH and DELETE.

## Routing with SimpleRouter class in DRF

If you have a class that extends ViewSets then you can use different types of built-in routers to map those classes in
your urls.py file. Doing things this way means you don’t have to map the individual methods as you did in the previous
section. Initiate a SimpleRouter object and map the class in the urls.py file in your Django app as follows.

```python
from rest_framework.routers import SimpleRouter
router = SimpleRouter(trailing_slash=False)
router.register('books', views.BookView, basename='books')
urlpatterns = router.urls
```

After mapping, you can access the api/books and api/books/1 endpoints with the same methods as in the previous example.

Did you notice that the argument trailing_slash=False was passed, instantiating the SimpleRouter object? Without this
argument, your API endpoints will have a trailing slash. And, since you don’t want a trailing slash at the end of your
API endpoints, you have to pass this argument.

## Routing with DefaultRouter class in DRF

There is another type of router called DefaultRouter which provides an extra benefit over the SimpleRouter. It creates
an API root endpoint with a trailing slash that displays all your API endpoints in one place. You can use it this way in
the urls.py file.

```python
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
router = DefaultRouter(trailing_slash=False)
router.register('books', views.BookView, basename='books')
urlpatterns = router.urls
```

Again, after mapping, you can access the api/books and api/books/1 endpoints with the same methods as in the previous
examples.

Additionally, you can access the API root view when you visit the http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/ endpoint. This will display
all the available endpoints as in the screenshot below.

You can read about all of these routers and more in the DRF documentation shared in the additional resources of this
lesson.
