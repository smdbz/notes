# Mock APIs

## Introduction

When developing APIs, it can take a long time before clients can start using them. Fortunately, as an API developer, you
can use the mocking technique to provide the same output as a real API endpoint.

A mock API imitates the real API endpoint with fake data so that the client application developers can start development
before the actual API is developed. This allows them to develop their apps without waiting for the production APIs to go
live.

In mock API outputs, the data structure remains correct, but the values are fake. And you don’t do any kind of business
logic process for these mock data. You just return some pre-generated hard-coded data as a response.

## How it works

When you create the mock API endpoints with fake data, both the API developers and the client application developers can
evaluate the output and instantly. They'll understand what data they will get from an API call or what data they should
deliver.

Then, based on these mock APIs endpoints and their output, these developers can start coding the client applications.
They don’t need to wait for the API developers to finish implementing these APIs because they already know what type of
data they will get.

And finally, when the actual API is ready, the client application developers will change those mock API endpoints with
the real endpoints. Client applications are easier to maintain when using mock API tools.

There are two major steps involved in creating Mock APIs. First, you create mock data that you can deliver from the mock
API endpoints. And the second step is to create mock API endpoints and serve those data.

## Mock API tools

You can search for Mock API Data Generator in your browser and get plenty of tools that you can use for free. Similarly,
searching for Mock API Endpoints will give you access to some handy free services too.

Mockaroo is a popular fake data generator service that you can use for free, which is available from www.mockaroo.com

Mockapi is a popular mock API service that you can use to create mock API endpoints for free, which you can access
at https://mockapi.io/

## Conclusion

In this reading, you learned how mock APIs can speed up development. Mocking APIs play an essential role in API
development because client application developers don't need to wait for the actual API to become live. It minimises the
time of development and reduces the dependencies between API developers and client application developers.
