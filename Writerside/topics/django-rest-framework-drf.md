# Django Rest Framework (DRF)

## Introduction

## Installation

## Serializers
Although Django's built in
templating system is great for
developing web applications,
DRF provides more functionalities.
Because when it comes to API development,
you need to be able to deal with other data types like
JSON and XML and this is where DRF comes in handy.
You will frequently need to
retrieve data from the database,
process it, and then
represent it to your clients as mainly JSON.
This conversion process is called serialization.
One of the DRF's biggest benefits


Handling JSON and xml formats
